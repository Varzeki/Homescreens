	<h3>Welcome to the #homescreen KLWP tutorial. We're going to start by covering the basics of shapes, which will give you a general idea of how to shape your homescreen. This tutorial will cover a few common shapes and their properties.</h3>
	<p>Go ahead and tap the "+" icon at the top right of your screen and select "Shape". Congratulations, you made your first shape. Inside the main options page, you'll see that it defaults to a square, so we're going to start with a square too. This first page should be pretty self explanatory; width will change the sides of the square, corners will round out your edges, and rotation will give you a plethora of options to define how your shape is rotated.</p>
	<p>Now, let's go to the next tab, called "paint". Here, you'll find color options for your shape. Fill will paint the whole shape while stroke will outline it with the given width. Skip the "position" tab for now and head on over to the "FX" tab. This gives you a few advanced options for your shape, such as being able to make it show an image, give it a gradient, or blur your background (if your shape is not inside another container, which will be explained later). Finally, you have the "animation" and "touch" tabs which will also be discussed later."
	<p>Back to the "position" tab, this defines where your shape is drawn from. As you can see, the default anchor is "top", aka "top center" so the shape will stick to the top center. Change it to something like "center left" and you will see your shape jump over to the center left of the screen. You can use this tab to position your shape by adding X/Y offset or top/bottom/left/right padding.</p>
	<p>Let's talk about some different shapes now. If you go back to the first tab, change "square" to "circle" and we'll see it's similar, but without the "corners" option because circles don't have corners. Switch it to "rectangle" and we'll be given an extra option to change: instead of just "width", we also have "height". The same principle applies to all the shape choices, allowing you to create any shape possible.</p>
